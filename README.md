Sundial Travel Blog: Where Women Travelers Connect!!!!
---
In this application, I created a social media blogging website for solo women travelers who want to share their stories and experiences.

This respository is the back-end application, while the following link is the front-end api application: https://github.com/Kerah-Jones/Travel-Blog-Api.

Both application were created from scratch. This is phase one of this application which give the users the opportunity to create a blog and post it to the board for others to view, however, only the owner of that post can update and delete. Users are also about to write a review/comment for a blog post. Phase two will consist of the ability to ,update review, delete review, and like a post.

I enjoyed building my front-end application (hint: the css). I knew the first thing I needed to do was create my froms to house my required feilds from my api in my back-end application. It was such a wonderful feeling to push my submit button, and have my console log show suceessful when a event was completed sucessfully. I would say I had a issue with the review side of my application on the front-end more than my back-end. I use handle bars to show my blogs on the page, and I knew i wanted to show my review form on the bottom of every reieve post. Also with using handlebars, I had to link my review form to my apps.js and events.js a bit differently to have the submit button connect to the JavaScript. I was able to successfully acomplish this task with some problem solving. 

Of Course there are some extra features I would like to add to the front-end to make the user experience that much better (hint: a delete button for each blog, and a edit button that renders the form as is and user is able to edit straight from the post without having to put blogid, title, and post all over again.)
