Sundial Travel Blog: Where Women Travelers Connect!!!!
---
In this application, I created a social media blogging website for solo women travelers who want to share their stories and experiences.

This respository is the back-end application, while the following link is the front-end api application: https://github.com/Kerah-Jones/travel-blog-api.

Both application were created from scratch. This is phase one of this application which give the users the opportunity to create a blog and post it to the board for others to view, however, only the owner of that post can update and delete. Users are also about to write a review/comment for a blog post. Phase two will consist of the ability to ,update review, delete review, and like a post.

This is the link to my live site https://kerah-jones.github.io/travel-blog-client.
