In this application, I created a social media blogging website for solo women travelers who want to share their story and experiences. This respository is the front end application, while the following link is the back-end api application: https://github.com/Kerah-Jones/travel-blog-api. Both application were created from scratch. This is phase one of this application which give the users the opportunity to create a blog and pst it to the board for others the view, however, only the owner of that post can update and delete. Phase two will consist of the appility to like and comment. This the link to my live site https://kerah-jones.github.io/travel-blog-client.
